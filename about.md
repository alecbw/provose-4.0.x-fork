# About Provose

Provose is the easiest way to manage your Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. Provose creates high-level abstractions over multiple AWS services, making it easy to deploy and manage complex infrastructure without managing all of the details.

Provose is an MIT-licensed open source project. It was incubated at [Neocrym](https://neocrym.com), a record label that uses artificial intelligence to find and promote musicians.

Provose was founded by [James Mishra](https://jamesmishra.com), the CEO of Neocrym. The near-entirety of Neocrym's AWS infrastructure currently runs on Provose's main branch.
