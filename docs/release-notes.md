# Provose v3.0 Release notes
Provose 3.0 comes with a number of improvements aimed at simplifying deployments. There are not a whole lot of new features compared to version 2.0, but this is a a major version bump because some changes may be incompatible.

Users migrating up from version 2.0 may notice that this version creates many more AWS tags. This should help users track their cloud expenses with more granularity in AWS Cost Explorer.
