# Provose v1.1 Release notes

Provose v1.1 is the first incremental release for Provose. This version focused on improvements to the [`containers` module](../containers/). Notably, users can save a lot of money by switching their AWS Fargate clusters to the `"FARGATE_SPOT"` capacity provider. More information can be found in the [changelog](/changelog/).
