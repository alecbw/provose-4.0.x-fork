# Changelog

## v1.0.2

**June 28, 2020.**

- Various minor fixes to the Provose documentation.
- We checked in an example `terraform.tf` to the root of the Provose GitHub repository, but this file was causing errors with Terraform so we subsequently removed it.

## v1.0.1

**June 22, 2020**

- Fixed an error when computing the `for_each` values for Elastic File System mount targets.

## v1.0.0

**June 19, 2020.**

This is the initial release, so from a philosophical standpoint, there have not been any changes yet.

Despite this being marked as a 1.0 release, Provose is still alpha-quality software.
