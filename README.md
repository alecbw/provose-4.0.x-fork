## Here is what Provose code looks like.

Below is an example of what Provose looks like, provisioning
[a single AWS EC2 instance](https://provose.com/v1.0/reference/aws_instance.html):

```terraform
module "myproject" {
  source = "github.com/provose/provose?ref=v1.0.0"
  provose_config = {
    authentication = {
      aws = {
        region = "us-east-1"
      }
    }
    name                 = "myproject"
    internal_root_domain = "example-internal.com"
    internal_subdomain   = "production"
  }
  ec2_instances = {
    my-instance = {
      public_tcp        = [22]
      purchasing_option = "ON_DEMAND"
      instances = {
        instance_type = "t3.micro"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

Provose is a [HashiCorp Terraform module](https://www.terraform.io/), and needs the [latest version of Terraform installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) on your machine to run.

Additionally, Provose also depends on the [AWS CLI version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) to run additional configuration commands not yet supported in Terraform.

If you want to build and deploy Docker images with Provose, you will also need the [`docker` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your machine.

## Installation

Follow the [Tutorial](https://provose.com/v1.0/tutorial/) for instructions on how to install and use Provose.
